# MNIST
My analysis of the MNIST data set, implementing ML algorithms to try and correctly classify handwritten digital images.


An ML project from data cleaning and preparation through to model selection and evaluation. Following my reading of Aurelion Geron's 'Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'

To use:
1. run the MNIST.py file to generate a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier trained on the MNIST dataset. This is a .pkl model file ready to predict handwritten labels
    i) to dive deeper into model analysis
